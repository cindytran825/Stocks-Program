How to run from the jar file:
copy the StocksCindy with the UserPortfolio and CSVFiles in the StocksCindy directory:
1. go to terminal, change current directory to the folder with this assignment (on the same level
as StocksCindy)
2. copy the StocksCindy and its content to the home directory (cp -r StocksCindy ~/StocksCindy)
3. run the jar file from anywhere

there is also a weird bug (I've went to office hours for this and figured out that the problem
was not in the code, but the software), where if you run it, sometimes you get an error saying that
StockApi cannot be found.

How to create portfolio with three different stocks:
You would write 'port-create' into the terminal.
it would then ask for the name of the portfolio of your choosing.
you would then add a ticker and the amount of shares. it would then ask you to
add another ticker, you can add as much as you like.
WHen you are done adding the stocks, hit 'j' and that should add the stocks
into the portfolio.
Creating another portfolio:
You can just do 'port-create' again to make another portfolio (preferably with a different name)
and add as many stocks as you like.
'port-view' to see the list of portfolios you have created.

List of Stocks:
