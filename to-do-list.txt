Office hours Question:

- do we need to write any new tests? mock tests for the guiController for example..
- is there a way to read inputs specifically from the controller (without having to return the button).
in our buy/sell and composition/value cases in the actionPerformed method, it reads the combobox by
calling the view to get the combobox, and reading the input. Is there an alternative way to this approach
- how to fix frozen panel classes?
